# Summary

## Notes

1. `Event.isTrusted`

    The read-only property of the `Event` interface is a boolean that is true when the event was generated by a user action, and false when the event was created or modified by a script or dispatched vis dispatchEvent. 
    
    In another word, if we have a click event. If a user clicks to trigger it, `isTrusted` is true. If it's controled by JS, then it's false.
