    5 values: [see demo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space)
    
    * `normal`: sequences of white space are collapsed. Newline characters in the source are handled the same as other white space. Lines are broken as necessary to fill line boxes.
    * `nowrap`: collapses white space as for `normal`, but *suppresses* line breaks (text wrapping) w/in the source.
    * `pre`: sequences of white space are *preserved*. Lines are *only* broken at newline characters in the source and at `<br>` elements.
    * `pre-wrap`: sequences of white space are *preserved*. Lines are broken at newline characters, at `<br>`, and as necessary to fill line boxes.
    * `pre-line`: sequences fo white space are *collapsed*. Lines are broken at newline characters, at `<br>`, and as necessary to fill line boxes.
